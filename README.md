# personal_portfolio
I already have a personal portfolio, but it's only saved locally. I also
decided that it's time for an upgrade. It's also annoying clicking through
a bunch of tabs to find what I'm looking for. I am tasking myself with creating a
better portfolio that looks good and is fucntionable.
